# pre-push_test.sh — regression tests for the release-tag gate in pre-push
# (constitution Principle III: a bug fix ships with a test that fails without
# the fix).
#
# check-linkage.sh is replaced by a stub, so the tests are hermetic: no network,
# no milestones, same result on a laptop and on a runner. What is under test is
# the hook's own decisions — which refs it gates, which it lets by, and whether
# it fails closed.
#
# Note what is absent. The gate this replaced had to be tested against `xargs`,
# `sudo`, `bash -c`, subshells, line continuations and heredocs, because it
# guessed at command text. git reports the refs directly, so that entire class
# of test has nothing to assert: the same four fields arrive however the push
# was invoked.
