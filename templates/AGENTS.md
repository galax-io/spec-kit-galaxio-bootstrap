## Boundaries

**Always:** format before commit, branch from `main`, keep commits semantic and green, preserve backward compat for published public APIs and any downstream consumers. `{{DEP_MANIFEST}}` = dependency truth, `.github/workflows/` = CI/release truth.

**Ask first:** new deps or upgrades, changing public API signatures / observable behavior / serialized formats, editing another repo, release/publish workflow changes.

**Never:** force-push or commit to `main`, merge commits in PR branches (rebase only), commit broken code, opportunistic refactors outside scope, mock external systems where a real integration path exists.

## Milestones (ALWAYS)

Every piece of work is tied to a milestone. No exceptions unless explicitly told otherwise.

- **Every PR** must be assigned to the active milestone before merging. No milestone = do not merge.
- **Issues are for important tasks**, not technical ones. A PR that completes one writes `Closes owner/repo#N` (the issue closes when the PR lands on `main`); one PR of several writes `Part of owner/repo#N`. A linked issue carries the PR's milestone. A technical PR (sync, pins, docs, CI) needs no issue: its commit already records it.
- **Spec work** (`specs/BCKLG-<N>-*/`) belongs to the milestone that owns the spec and travels in the feature's backlog PR together with its work, never in a PR of its own. Link that PR to the milestone immediately when creating it.
- **Active milestone** = the lowest-numbered open milestone that matches the current spec/plan. Check `gh api repos/{{ORG_REPO}}/milestones` if unsure.

## Task number (ALWAYS)

A task of the backlog has one number across the organization: `BCKLG-<N>`, where `<N>` is its issue number in `galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog`. It is the only number a spec gets, and it names the task wherever `#N` alone would be read as an issue or PR of another repository.

- **Spec.** Its directory is `specs/BCKLG-<N>-<name>/`, `<N>` its main task. Its `spec.md`, `plan.md` and `tasks.md` carry the line `**Задачи**: BCKLG-<N>[, BCKLG-<M>…]` under the title, or `**Tasks**: …` in a repository whose files are English only, read alike: every task it carries, the main one first. A task has one spec: before writing one, find the spec whose tasks line names the task, check it against the task as its issue says now, and update it rather than write another. A spec directory from before the number keeps its name.
- **Branch.** A task's documents branch in the backlog is `spec/BCKLG-<N>-<name>`, whether made by hand or by the engine, which works on it and opens no other branch in the backlog; the engine's run is `BCKLG-<N>-<time>`, and its branches in the code repositories are `sdlc/BCKLG-<N>-<time>`.
- **Commit.** A commit that does a task's work carries the trailer `Refs: BCKLG-<N>`; its subject stays a Conventional Commit.
- **PR.** Its body carries the line `Refs: BCKLG-<N>` beside `Part of galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog#<N>`, or beside `Closes galax-io/galaxio-sdlc-backlog#<N>` in the task's documents PR.
- **Checked.** `scripts/check-linkage.sh --pr` fails a PR of a feature without its number, a spec directory it adds that is not named by a task, and a spec, plan or tasks without the tasks line; `--specs` checks every spec of a checkout.

## Commits & PRs

- **Spec-first.** `specs/BCKLG-<N>-<feature>/` artifacts → `docs(speckit): add BCKLG-<N>-<feature> spec/plan/tasks` as the first commit of the backlog PR that carries the feature's work, BEFORE any `feat`/`fix`. Never folded into an implementation commit, never a spec-only PR; that PR merges together with the feature's PRs in the other repositories (backlog constitution, Principle II).
- **1 issue = 1 commit.** Each tracked GitHub issue maps to one semantic commit (`feat(scope): … (#NNN)`), green on its own (`{{BUILD_TEST_CMD}}`). Docs, tweaks, and out-of-scope improvements go in separate PRs — never mixed with issue commits.
- **Intent, not path.** No add-then-remove within a PR. Squash churn before review.
- **1 concern per PR.** Feature ≠ docs/README. Stack dependent PRs; update with `--force-with-lease`.
- **Idiomatic code.** Follow the language's idioms and the conventions already in the codebase; no control-flow-by-exception, no dead/duplicated code.

## Agents & Models (ALWAYS)

Route work by the reasoning it needs, not by habit; parallelize only where agents would not rebuild the same context. Every model is the newest of its class that the accounts can run; an older one is never used.

| Tier | Claude (effort) | Codex (effort) | Work |
|---|---|---|---|
| deep | `claude-opus-5-5` (xhigh) | `gpt-6.1-sol` (xhigh) | complex code, review and verification (every critic), research, root-cause analysis, specs/plans, architecture |
| light | `claude-sonnet-5-5` (high) | `gpt-6.1-sol` (high) | simpler work a plan already spells out: task/issue generation, mechanical infra (CI config, version pins, renames, doc fixes) |
| trivial | `claude-haiku-5-5` (medium) | `gpt-6-luna` (medium) | very simple edits, gathering context, finding files, bookkeeping |
| exceptional | — | `gpt-6-astra` (xhigh) | only when the maintainer names it for a task; no agent and not the engine chooses it |

- **Newest only.**
  - When a newer model of a class appears, this table and every pin of it move to it in the same change: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/agents/`, `setup-speckit.sh`, and any code that routes models.
  - Luna and Astra stay at 6 because Codex refuses `gpt-6.1-luna` and `gpt-6.1-astra` to a ChatGPT account.
  - `gpt-6.1-sol` needs Codex CLI 0.162 or later.
  - Claude Code's own aliases and its background model are pinned to the table in `.claude/settings.json` (`env`: `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`, `…_SONNET_MODEL`, `…_HAIKU_MODEL`, `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL`). Without that pin its `haiku` alias means an older Haiku.
- **Codex has no middle model.** Light work runs Sol on high effort, one less than deep; Luna is for trivial work only.
- **Reviews are deep.** Every critic and reviewer runs at the deep tier, on the other vendor than the work it judges.
- **Research is adversarial.** Deep research gets a second opinion from the other vendor (`deep-researcher` does this via `codex exec --sandbox read-only`). A claim only one model supports is unverified, not a fact.
- **Every task carries its tier.** `tasks.md` lines add `[tier:deep]`, `[tier:light]` or `[tier:trivial]` next to `[P]`, and issues carry the matching `tier:*` label where the project labels them. When unsure, it is deep.
- **Parallelize by context, not by file.**
  - Every sub-agent builds its own context from scratch. Agents that must read the same code, spec, or repository repeat that cost and leave integration work behind.
  - `[tier:deep]` work that shares a context runs in one agent, task after task: the main session or a single deep sub-agent. This holds even when `[P]` marks the tasks as parallelizable.
  - Fan deep work out only where each agent's context differs: separate repositories, or subsystems an agent can learn without the others.
  - `[tier:light]` mechanical work (`infra-worker`) and `[tier:trivial]` work (`trivial-worker`) may fan out freely.
  - Dependent tasks stay sequential.
- **Pinned, not remembered.**
  - `setup-speckit.sh` pins spec-kit skills to their tier; override with `SPECKIT_DEEP_MODEL` / `SPECKIT_LIGHT_MODEL`.
  - `.claude/agents/` defines the tiered sub-agents, each with its tier's model and `effort`.
  - Where a project routes models in code, it routes by this table: a task or stage names its tier, and each harness runs its own vendor's model of that tier. A model outside the table is an error.

## Release Process (MANDATORY)

Trunk-based with release branches. Trunk is `main`; `release/*` branches are cut from `main` for stabilization. Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag on `main` or a `release/*` branch triggers the release workflow ({{PUBLISH_MECHANISM}}) and creates a GitHub Release ({{RELEASE_NOTES_TOOL}}).

### Minor/Major release (e.g. 1.2.0, 2.0.0)

1. `git checkout -b release/X.Y.0 main` — cut release branch from `main`
2. `git push -u origin release/X.Y.0`
3. `git tag vX.Y.0` on the release branch
4. `git push origin vX.Y.0` — triggers release workflow

### Patch release (e.g. 1.2.1)

1. Fix lands on `main` first (via PR as usual)
2. `git cherry-pick <fix-sha>` onto `release/X.Y.0`
3. `git tag vX.Y.1` on the release branch
4. `git push origin vX.Y.1` — triggers release workflow

### Rules

- **Every minor version gets its own `release/X.Y.0` branch** — no exceptions
- **Tags ONLY on `release/*` branches or `main`** — `release.yml` validates this
- **Branch name must match tag version**: `release/1.2.0` → `v1.2.0`, `v1.2.1`, etc.
- **Never delete a release tag** after the registry deployment starts — creates stuck deployments
- **Never reuse a version number** — most package registries reject duplicates permanently
- **Before tagging**: every PR merged since the previous tag must be assigned to the milestone; every issue in the milestone whose fix is on `main` must be closed
